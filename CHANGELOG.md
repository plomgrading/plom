# Plom Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.19.2] - 2025-09-11

### Added
* Papers can be downloaded in their "unmarked" state.
* Support for fractional rubrics has improved: instructions can set their preferences about fractional rubrics, currently 1/2 and 1/4 points are visible in the UI.
* The Scan thumbnail app where extra pages are assigned has numerous improvements, including the ability to see the cover sheets of the next and previous papers in the bundle.

### Removed
* Several not-very-maintained `manage.py` commands in favour of `plom-cli`, which works remotely over the API.

### Changed
* The spec has changed format: the `select` key accepts a single integer or a list of integers.  Question versions are randomly drawn from this list.  If omitted, defaults to all versions.
* The printed papers now say "Paper 0123" not "Test 0123" on top of the page.
* `marks.csv` now respects custom "question labels".
* The UI of the server now "vendors" most javascript dependencies on startup, for a more standalone server.

### Fixed
* Fix table-sorting by clicking on column headers, in several tables.
* Misc bug fixes and minor improvements.



## [0.18.3] - 2025-06-14

### Changed
* UI tweaks, text clarifications, and misc code cleanups,

### Fixed
* Single-digit microQR codes could be mistaken for extra page QR codes, sometimes leading crashes.

* Fixes related to discarding an entire paper.
* Fixes to students reports.


## [0.18.2] - 2025-05-23

### Added
* Rubric templates can be downloaded showing what is needed in csv/json/toml if you want to make rubrics outside of Plom.

* New API to remotely reset tasks, usable via the client as well as `plom-cli`.
* Rubrics can be created in the web UI as well as the client.
* `plom-new-server` and `plom-new-demo` command line tools, subject to renaming without notice in the future.

### Changed

### Added
* Server can now be run using the "Django-Silk" profiler, if enabled in `settings.py`.
* Server respects additional environment variables `PLOM_HUEY_WORKERS` and `PLOM_HUEY_PARENT_WORKERS` to control how many background workers are used.  Current defaults (subject to change) are 4 and 2, and are set in `settings.py`.

### Fixed
* Many performance improvements to services that were using too manyi or inefficient database queries, based on real-life experiences at scale, and from using the "Django-Silk" profiler.
* Client: fixed a crash when editing a copy of someone else's rubric.


## [0.16.8] - 2024-10-15

* Server was rendering some rubric table headers incorrectly.
* Improved client refresh, especially when other users tag your tasks.
* Client: don't crash on URLs with trailing slash.
* Client: can now ID paper number zero.
* Misc bug fixes.

* Spec verifier now checks that numberOfPages is even.


## [0.15.4] - 2024-05-21

### Added
* Scanning (on the new server) defaults to automatic image extraction (if its detected safe to do so).  Scanners can force "safe mode rendering" for the previous behaviour.

### Added
* Identifier: UI includes explanation of why we confirm prenamed papers.

### Changed
* The "new" `idBox3.pdf` was giving warnings in LaTeX: new `idBox4.pdf` is now a 1.5 PDF.
* Client: experimental "view cat pic" feature removed; it was often offline and the content could be construed as endorsed by Plom.

### Fixed
* Client: temporary workaround for Qt bug resulting in overly-long error dialogs on macOS.
* Previous compiled clients `0.14.x` produced imperceptibly corrupted annotated images due to bugs in jpeg libraries, causing rare problems with some PDF viewers on the reassembled files.
* Client: crash when sorted columns in the rarely-used "filter/arrange" dialog.
* Dependency and documentation updates.


## [0.14.7] - 2023-12-03

### Added
* Support for Python 3.12.

### Changed
* Clients: more dialogs have "Don't ask me again" checkboxes.

* Documentation and misc fixes.


## [0.14.5] - 2023-10-23

### Added
* New "idBox3.pdf" template moves the signature box up to avoid signatures hitting the bounding box (which was leading to additional manual IDing).
* Page Arrange: new "Invert selection" button is useful to quickly discard all but the highlighted pages.

### Changed
* Do more checks before uploading a custom version map, hopefully avoiding errors that are hard to recover from.
* Making self-signed certs no longer needs command-line `openssl`, instead uses the `cryptography` package.

### Fixed
* Client: crash from invalid version restrictions specified in the Add Rubric dialog.
* Legacy server was not creating backup files on regrade since sometime in 2022.

## [0.13.3] - 2023-04-25

### Changed
* Client: when a rubric group tab is selected, adding a new rubric defaults to that group.
* Manager: the Dangling Pages tab must be manually refreshed.

## [0.12.1] - 2023-01-27

### Added
* `plom-create` command line tool can list and clear paper id prediction tables.

    - Rubrics can be organized into groups such as "(a)" which correspond to
      shared tabs.
