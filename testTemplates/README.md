Templates for Plom Assessments
==============================

These are example templates you can use for preparing a test or exam
to use with Plom.


LaTeX templates
---------------

We provide `latexTemplate.tex`, an example with good margins that work
well with our QR code placement.


Using a word processor
----------------------

Of course, you do not need to use LaTeX to prepare your assessment.
The included `idBox.pdf` should be used as a template for students to
enter their name and student number.  This standard template will help
with the automated optical character recognition of student numbers.


Extra sheets
------------

Generally we recommend leaving lots of space on the page.  But if a
student runs out of space and needs extra paper, you can have them
write on any paper, just make sure its labelled with their student
number and their Plom paper number.  We provide an appropriate
template for this called `extraSheets.tex`.

If you want to enforce blind-grading, see `extraSheets_noname.tex`.

Make sure you print these double-sided!


Source code for misc support files
----------------------------------

There are several ways to build `idBox` and `idBox2` from sources. First, with fewer steps, run
  * `pdflatex idBox2-source.tex`
  * `pdfcrop --margins -1 idBox2-source.pdf idBox2.pdf`
  * `pdf2svg idBox2.pdf idBox2.svg`

Or, if you have inkscape installed you can get pdf and svg easily:
  * `pdflatex idBox2-source.tex`
  * `inkscape --pdf-poppler --export-area-drawing idBox2-source.pdf -o idBox2.pdf`
  * `inkscape --pdf-poppler --export-area-drawing --export-plain-svg idBox2-source.pdf -o idBox2.svg`

Alternatively, with more steps and intermediaries, but a smaller file size, we run
  * `latex idBox4-source.tex`
  * `dvips idBox4-source.dvi`
  * `ps2eps -f idBox4-source.ps`
  * `epstopdf -hires idBox4-source.eps`
  * `pdfcrop --margins -1 idBox4-source.pdf idBox4.pdf`
  * `pdf2svg idBox4.pdf idBox4.svg`
  * `pdftops idBox4.pdf -eps`

With a single command:
  * `A=idBox4 && latex $A-source.tex && dvips $A-source.dvi && ps2eps -f $A-source.ps && epstopdf -hires $A-source.eps && pdfcrop --margins -1 $A-source.pdf $A.pdf && pdf2svg $A.pdf $A.svg && pdftops $A.pdf -eps`
    (this was precisely how `idBox4.pdf` and `idBox4.eps` were created in 2023-12 on Fedora 39.)

Note that without the extra `margins` argument `pdfcrop` leaves a 1pt white margin around the idbox.
