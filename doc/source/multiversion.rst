Multi-version assessments
=========================

Plom is designed for giving multi-version assessments suitable for
crowded classrooms and multiple sittings.

You provide several versions of your assessment, and Plom interleaves
questions from each version to create a large number distinct
assessments.

Plom produces a different PDF file for each student by
"slicing-and-dicing" your input "sources".


Restrictions
------------

For this interleaving to be possible, and for scoring to be practical,
different versions of a question must take the occupy the same page(s)
and must be worth the same number of points.

Loosening these restrictions is probably possible in theory, but none
of the built-in tooling will help you do this.

Any questions that share a page must be the same version (this will
happen automatically if you let Plom create the version mapping).


The question-version mapping
----------------------------

.. tip::
   The first time you use Plom, we recommend using just a single
   version of your assessment (and skipping this section!)

When creating a multi-versioned assessment, a critically-important
step is the creation of the "QV map" or the "question-version
mapping", which tells Plom what versions to expect for each question
and for each paper.

You can have Plom create this mapping for you, where the assessment
specification describes which versions each question may be drawn from.

Alternatively, finer control is possible by uploading a .csv file
specifying which assessment version should be used for each question
on each paper. In this case, the versions for each question in the
assessment specification are overridden.

.. caution::
   Its a good idea to download and backup a copy of your QV-map.  If
   something goes catastrophically wrong, it (and the specification)
   are crucial components to recreate your assessment elsewhere.



Multiversioning FAQs
--------------------

I want to use different versions of my ID page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, maybe you want to interleave versions 1 and 2 for section
101 and version 3 for section 102.
In this case you might want to write "Section 101" on the front (ID)
page of papers numbered 1-199 and "Section 102" on papers 200-350.
This can be done by adding a ``id.version`` column to your custom "QV
map" ``.csv`` file.

.. danger::
   Versioned ID-pages is a new feature, without much (any?) real-world
   testing.  Use at your own risk.  If you've tested it, please get in
   touch so we can remove this message following your act of bravery.


Can I create my own per-student PDFs and use multiversioning?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes.  You need only provide Plom with your chosen question-version
map.


In that case, could different versions of Q1 and Q2 share a page?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, provided you make the individualized PDF files yourself.
