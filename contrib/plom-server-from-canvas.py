"""Build and populate a Plom server from a Canvas Assignment.

The goal is automate using Plom as an alternative to Canvas's
SpeedGrader.

This is very much *pre-alpha*: not ready for production use, use at
your own risk, no warranty, etc, etc.

1. Create a Canvas API key on the Canvas site, it looks something like;
   ```
   11224~AABBCCDDEEFF...
   ```
2. Run `python3 plom-server-from-canvas.py`
3. Follow prompts.
4. Go the directory you created and run `plom-server launch`.

Notes:
  * TODO: needs to log instead of just discarding so much output
  * TODO: support an existing configured server in basedir: or fork
