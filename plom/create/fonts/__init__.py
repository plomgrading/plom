"""Fonts based on handwriting samples of the people who wrote this module.

To add a new font based on your own handwriting, we have used the
tool Handwrite (https://pypi.org/project/handwrite).  Its not necessary
to commit the PDF/jpeg source, just the resulting font.

As indicated at the top of this init file, the fonts are licensed under
the LGPL-3.0-or-later by default (the license chosen by Elizabeth Xiao
who did the first one).  If you prefer a different license, speak up
and we'll document them each separately.
