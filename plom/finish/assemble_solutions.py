        short_name (str): the name of this exam, a form appropriate for
            a filename prefix, e.g., "math107mt1".
        max_marks (dict): the maximum mark for each question, keyed by the
            question number, which seems to be a string.
        t (int): paper number.
        sid (str/None): The student number as a string.  Maybe `None` which
            means that student has no ID (?)  Currently we just skip these.
        watermark (bool): whether to watermark solns with student-id.
