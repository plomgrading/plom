class HueyTaskTracker(models.Model):
    """A general-purpose model for tracking Huey tasks.

    It keeps track of a Huey task's ID, the time created, and the
    status. Also, this is where we define the functions for handling
    signals sent from the huey consumer.

    TODO: well we don't actually define those here, they are in global
    scope outside this class.  See TODO above.

    When you create one of these, set status to ``TO_DO`` or ``STARTING``,
    choosing ``STARTING`` if just about to enqueue a Huey task.
    The Huey task should (eventually) update the status to ``RUNNING``.
    In the meantime, you can change status to ``QUEUED`` (provided you
    are careful not to overwrite ``RUNNING``!)
    Generally the Huey task itself should set status ``COMPLETE``.

    The difference between STARTING, QUEUED, and RUNNING is rather
    sensitive to timing.  Caller can set STARTING and try to set
    QUEUED (but must defer to the Huey task itself about RUNNING.

    .. caution:: These statuses are not just symbolic constants; they
        also appear as strings through the code as
        "To Do", "Starting", "Queued", "Running", "Error", "Complete".
        Note the difference in cases.  They are displayed to users.
        They are also used in logic tests.

    ``obsolete=True`` is a "light deletion; no one cares for the result
    and it should not be used.  It is ok to change status (e.g., a
    background task finishes a chore that no one cares about anymore is
    free to complete the chore---or not!)  Obsolete is not the same as
    ``ERROR``: a task could be in an error state but still relevant, for
    example, being displayed in a UI to show users it has errored.
