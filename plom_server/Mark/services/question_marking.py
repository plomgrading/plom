    """Handles the workflow of markers grading individual tasks.

    Takes care of handing out tasks and accepting marks:
        1. Marker makes a request for a new task to grade
        2. Server returns the best available task based on
            status and priority
        3. Marker makes a request to be assigned to that task
        4. Server double-checks if the task is available:
            - the status must be TO_DO
            - there must not be a user already assigned to the task
            and if so, assigns the user to the task.
        5. Marker annotates page-images and sends the annotations and
            mark to the server
        6. Server double-checks that the marker is still allowed to
            mark the task:
            - if the manager has assigned the task to someone else,
                the server rejects the annotations + mark
            - also, if the task's status has been changed to out-of-date,
                the server rejects the request
        7. Server saves mark, annotation data, and annotation image
        8. Return to step 5 - Marker is free to keep sending new marks for the task.
