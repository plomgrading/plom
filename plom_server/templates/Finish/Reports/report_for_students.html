        <h4>Explanation of this graph</h4>
        <p>
            Each question on this assessment was tagged by the instructor
            with a topic or learning objective. Above is a graph
            which indicates your proficiency in the identified topic. The
            score for each label is calculated as a weighted average of
            the score on the associated questions.
        </p>
        <!-- <p> -->
        <!--     For example, if Question 1 and Question 2 have the tag of -->
        <!--     <q>Learning Objective 1</q>, with scores of 4/10 and 8/10 -->
        <!--     respectively, then the score for Learning Objective 1 is -->
        <!--     calculated as the weighted average of the scores on -->
        <!--     Questions 1 and 2: 1/2 (4/10+8/10) = 0.6. -->
        <!-- </p> -->
        <p>
            The labelling of questions is meant to help identify topics/areas
            of strength and topics/areas for review.  If the score on a
            topic is low, it is strongly recommended to review the associated
            lecture notes, the associated section in the textbook, and/or
            discuss it with your instructor during an office hour.

    <h3>Boxplot of marks by question</h3>
    <p>
        In the boxplots below the distribution of marks for each question is shown.
        <ul>
            <li>The student mark is shown as a dot</li>
            <li>The median is shown as a thick vertical line in the middle of the box</li>
            <li>
                The box shows the 25-75 percentile range of marks and the extreme left/right vertical lines show the minimum and maximum marks.
