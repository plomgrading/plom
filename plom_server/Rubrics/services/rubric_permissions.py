# The order of this list is the order shown on screen.  It also

# before eighth, if the input is 4.25.
# * indent is used to visually indicate which rubrics imply others,
#   it is used with the Bootstrap "ms-n" margin setting.
# * some options imply others.
# TODO: would we ever want to default any of these on?
# Lots of these are supported but currently most are turned off in the UI
# by the `"show-in-ui"` key: change that to True to enable more fractions
