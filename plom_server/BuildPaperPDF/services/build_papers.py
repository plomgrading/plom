    """Build a single paper and prename it.

    It is important to understand that running this function starts an
    async task in queue that will run sometime in the future.
    The implementation starts with a "transition to running" and ends
    with an "transition to complete": one needs to be a bit careful about
    these to avoid race conditions with the caller.  In the future we
    might consider using a decorator for this pattern instead.

    Args:
        papernum: which paper to assemble
        spec: the specification of the assessment.
        qvmap_row: which version to use for each question and id page.
            A row of the "qvmap".
        source_versions: dict of paths to the PDF files for each version.

    Keyword Args:
        student_info: None for a regular blank paper or a dict with
            keys ``"id"`` and ``"name"`` for "prenaming" a paper.
        prename_config: A dict containing keys ``"xcoord"`` and
            ``"ycoord"``, used to position the prenaming box if student_info isn't None.
        tracker_pk: a key into the database for anyone interested in
            our progress.
        _debug_be_flaky: for debugging, all take a while and some
            percentage will fail.
        task: includes our ID in the Huey process queue.  This kwarg is
            passed by `context=True` in decorator: callers should not
            pass this in!

    Returns:
